```shell
# pull latest version
docker pull ghcr.io/drizzle-team/gateway:0.1.1 

# persistent volume is required for configuration file
docker volume create drizzle-gateway 

# start the studio
docker run -d \
  --name drizzle-gate \
  --restart always \
  -p 4983:4983 \
  -e PORT=4983 \ # Set the port for Drizzle Gateway (optional)

<Callout collapsed="How it works?">
Drizzle Studio server hosts an admin panel, which you can visit on `host:port`, when you access it first time - you need to link it with our `gateway.drizzle.studio` licensing server and login via GitHub.  
As soon as it's connected - you can now add Database Connections, it will prompt you to buy subscription($20/year for 1 slot, $50/year for 5 slots) and we have a 7 days free tier
we've also implemented the `customer` subscription if you setup this as a part of someones infrastructure and you want them to pay for the subscription obviously.  
  
Drizzle Gateway is compatible with both `arm` and `amd` architectures, you can use it on both MacOS(intel/m chips) and linux, whichever you prefer.  
  
It runs a Drizzle Gateway Server on `:4983` port, you can override it by providing `PORT` environment variable if needed.  
IMPORTANT: make sure to mount a persistent storage with `/app` root for Docker container, itâ€™s required to have a place where to store your session and recover on server restarts.  
  
To override `/app` root path - provide `STORE_PATH` environment variable.  
  
You can provide `MASTERPASS` env variably to have protected admin access, it will also unlock the `passcode` feature which you will be able to set for others to have protected access and without ability to change passcode.
