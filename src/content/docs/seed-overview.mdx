# Drizzle Seed 

`drizzle-seed` is a TypeScript library that helps you generate deterministic, yet realistic, 
fake data to populate your database. By leveraging a seedable pseudorandom number generator (pRNG), 
it ensures that the data you generate is consistent and reproducible across different runs.
 This is especially useful for testing, development, and debugging purposes.

#### What is Deterministic Data Generation?
Deterministic data generation means that the same input will always produce the same output. 
In the context of `drizzle-seed`, when you initialize the library with the same seed number, 
it will generate the same sequence of fake data every time. This allows for predictable and repeatable data sets.

#### Pseudorandom Number Generator (pRNG)
A pseudorandom number generator is an algorithm that produces a sequence of numbers 
that approximates the properties of random numbers. However, because it's based on an initial value 
called a seed, you can control its randomness. By using the same seed, the pRNG will produce the 
same sequence of numbers, making your data generation process reproducible.

#### Benefits of Using a pRNG:

- Consistency: Ensures that your tests run on the same data every time.
- Debugging: Makes it easier to reproduce and fix bugs by providing a consistent data set.
- Collaboration: Team members can share seed numbers to work with the same data sets.

With drizzle-seed, you get the best of both worlds: the ability to generate realistic fake data and the control to reproduce it whenever needed.

## Installation

<Npm>
drizzle-seed
</Npm>

## Basic Usage

In this example we will create 10 users with random names and ids

```ts {12}
import { pgTable, integer } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core'
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/node-postgres'
import { seed } from 'drizzle-seed'

const users = pgTable('users', {
    id: integer().primaryKey(),
    name: text().notNull()
});

async function main() {
    const db = drizzle(process.env.DATABASE_URL!);
    await seed(db, { users });
}

main();
```

## Options

**`count`** 

By default, the `seed` function will create 10 entities. 
However, if you need more for your tests, you can specify this in the seed options object

```ts
await seed(db, schema, { count: 1000 });
```

**`seed`**

If you need a seed to generate a different set of values for all subsequent runs, you can define a different number
in the `seed` option. Any new number will generate a unique set of values

```ts
await seed(db, schema, { seed: 12345 });
```

## Reset databases

With `drizzle-seed`, you can easily reset your database and seed it with new values, for example, in your test suites

```ts
// path to a file with schema you want to reset
import * as schema from './schema.ts'
import { reset } from 'drizzle-seed'

async function main() {
    const db = drizzle(process.env.DATABASE_URL!);
    await reset(db, schema);
}

main();
```

Different dialects will have different strategies for database resetting

<Tabs items={['PostgreSQL', 'MySQL', 'SQLite']}>
<Tab>
For PostgreSQL, the `drizzle-seed` package will generate `TRUNCATE` statements with the `CASCADE` option to 
ensure that all tables are empty after running the reset function

```sql
TRUNCATE tableName1, tableName2, ... CASCADE;
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
For MySQL, the `drizzle-seed` package will first disable `FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS` to ensure the next step won't fail, and then 
generate `TRUNCATE` statements to empty the content of all tables

```sql
SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 0;
TRUNCATE tableName1;
TRUNCATE tableName2;
...
SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 1;
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
For SQLite, the `drizzle-seed` package will first disable the `foreign_keys` pragma to ensure the next step won't fail, 
and then generate `DELETE FROM` statements to empty the content of all tables

```sql
PRAGMA foreign_keys = OFF;
DELETE FROM tableName1;
DELETE FROM tableName2;
...
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Refinements

In case you need to change the behavior of the seed generator functions that Drizzle-Seed uses by default, you can specify your own implementation and even use your own list of values for the seeding process

```ts
await seed(db, schema).refine((f) => ({
    users: {
        columns: {

        }
    },
    count: 10
}));
```
